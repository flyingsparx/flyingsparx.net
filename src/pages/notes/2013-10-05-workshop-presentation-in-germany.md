<p>Last week I visited Karlsruhe, in Germany, to give a presentation accompanying a recently-accepted paper. The paper, "Inferring the Interesting Tweets in Your Network", was in the proceedings of the Workshop on Analyzing Social Media for the Benefit of Society (<a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/node/12" target="_blank">Society 2.0</a>), which was part of the Third International Conference on Social Computing and its Applications (<a href="http://socialcloud.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/confs/SCA2013/" target="_blank">SCA</a>).</p>
<p>Although I only attended the first workshop day, there was a variety of interesting talks on social media and crowdsourcing. My own talk went well and there was some useful feedback from the attendees.</p>
<p>I presented my recent work on the use of machine learning techniques to help in identifying interesting information in Twitter. I rounded up some of the results from the Twinterest experiment we ran a few months ago and discussed how this helped address the notion of information <i>relevance</i> as an extension to global <i>interestingness</i>.</p>
<p>I hadn't been to Germany before this, so it was also a culturally-interesting visit. I was only there for two nights but I tried to make the most of seeing some of Karlsruhe and enjoying the traditional food and local beers!</p>
