<p>A <a href="http://www.willwebberley.net/#post/2012-11-13" target="_blank">few posts back</a>, I talked 
about the development of an Android app for tide predictions for South Wales. This app is now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.willwebberley.gowertides" target="_blank" style="color:#A4C639;">Google Play</a>.</p>
<p>If you live in South Wales and are vaguely interested in tides/weather, then you should probably download it :)</p>
<p>The main advantage is that the app does not need any data connection to display the tidal data, which is useful in areas 
with low signal. In future, I hope to add further features, such as a more accurate tide graph (using a proper 'wave'),
surf reports, and just general UI updates.</p>
