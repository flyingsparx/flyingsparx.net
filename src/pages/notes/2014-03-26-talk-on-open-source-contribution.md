title: Talk on Open-Source Contribution

<p>Today I gave an internal talk at the School of Computer Science & Informatics about open-source contribution.</p>
<p>The talk <!--[slides available <a href="http://will.now.sh/static/downloads/open_source_contributions.pdf">here</a>]--> described some of the disadvantages of the ways in which hobbyists and the non-professional sector publicly publish their code. A lot of the time these projects do not receive much visibility or use from others.</p>
<p>Public contribution is important to the open-source community, which is driven largely by volunteers and enthusiasts, so the point of the talk was to try and encourage people to share expert knowledge through contributing documentation (wikis, forums, articles, etc.), maintaining and adopting packages, and getting more widely involved.</p>
