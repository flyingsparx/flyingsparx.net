<p>
Next week I, along with others in a team, am taking part in <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/hackathon/" target="_blank">Cardiff Open Sauce Hackathon</a>.</p>
<p>If you're in the area and feel like joining in for the weekend then sign up at the link above.</p>
<p>The hackathon is a two-day event in which teams work to 'hack together' smallish projects, which will be open-sourced at the end of the weekend. Whilst we have a few ideas already for potential projects, if anyone has any cool ideas for something relatively quick, but useful, to make, then please <a href="/contact">let me know</a>!
