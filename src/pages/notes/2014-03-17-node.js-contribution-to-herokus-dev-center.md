title: Node.js Contribution to Heroku's Dev Center
layout: post
---

<p>I recently wrote a new article for Heroku's Dev Center on carrying out asynchronous direct-to-S3 uploads using Node.js.</p>
<p>The article is based heavily on the previous <a href="http://will.now.sh/blog/13/5/7/contribution-to-heroku-dev-center/">Python version</a>, where the only major change is the method for signing the AWS request. This method was outlined in an <a href="http://will.now.sh/blog/2014/1/17/direct-to-s3-uploads-in-node.js/">earlier blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The article is available <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/s3-upload-node">here</a> and there is also a <a href="https://github.com/willwebberley/NodeDirectUploader">companion code repository</a> for the example it describes.</p>
